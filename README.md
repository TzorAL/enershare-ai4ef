# leif-services

The repository for AI4F services for updating building energy class and forecasting effect of potential benefit at installing solar panels.

## Installation

This project is implemented in [Docker]((https://docs.docker.com/)) providing a complete image for the entire service -- see **Dockerfile** and **docker_compose.yml** file for details regarding installation and requirements/dependencies

| Entrypoint |            Filename           |
|:----------:|:-----------------------------:|
| api        | api.py                        |
| service 1  | classifier.py                 |
| service 2  | MLPRegresssor_HPO.py          |

The project also includes:
* **Dockerfile** and **docker_compose.yml**: docker files responsible for deploying the respective image, as well as **python_requirements.txt** that contains the pip dependencies required to do so.
* **service1_outputs.json** and **service1_outputs.json**: JSON files that contain each product targetâ€™s name, description, data type. Paired with the respective model forecasts, they are utilized by API as format for the user response sent to front-end.

```bash
docker compose build
docker compose up -d
```

## Data format

Our pipelines are currently capable of processing a single csv file at a time, for the purposes of the service. 
Data must: 
* be in csv format 
* contain the columns registered either by the user-provided values or default values of the commnand-line arguments (see service 2 for more details)
Please fill command line arguments refering to columns of the dataset provided, otherwise the code will **not** function properly

## Usage

### Service 1 (classifier)

Service 1 classification provides cross-validation grid search among many models and hyperparameter values to determine the most suitable combination:

| Algorithm      | Parameters                                                                                                        |
|----------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| KNN            | {'n_neighbors': [1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, 15], 'weights': ['uniform', 'distance']}                                |
| SVC            | {'estimator__kernel': ['rbf', 'linear'], 'estimator__gamma': ['scale', 'auto'], 'estimator__C': [10, 100, 1000]}  |
| LR             | {'estimator__penalty': ['none', 'l2'], 'estimator__C': [1.0, 0.5, 0.1], 'estimator__solver': ['lbfgs', 'liblinear']}|
| Decision Tree  | {'criterion': ['entropy'], 'max_depth': [6], 'min_samples_leaf': [1], 'min_samples_split': [4]}                  |
| Random Forest  | {'n_estimators': [200, 600], 'max_depth': [4, 10, None], 'min_samples_leaf': [1, 2, 5]}                           |
| MLP            | {'hidden_layer_sizes': [150, 100, 50], 'activation': ['relu', 'logistic', 'tanh'], 'solver': ['adam', 'lbfgs', 'sgd']}|
| XGBoost        | {'learning_rate': [0.1, 0.2, 0.3], 'max_depth': [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6], 'min_child_weight': [1, 2], 'subsample': [1.0, 0.5, 0.1], 'n_estimators': [200, 600]}|

Currently classsifier does not support custom command line arguments as features as their hardcoded in the code

Service 2 uses python's [click](https://click.palletsprojects.com/en/8.1.x/api/) to edit these parameter using command line arguments. Please refer to their documentation for further details.

**Example:** 
```bash
python MLPRegressor_HPO.py --dir_in ../Sol_pan_comp.csv/ --seed 42 --n_trials 20 --max_epochs 300 --n_layers 1 --layer_sizes 100 --l_window 240 --f_horizon 24

### FastAPI 

FastAPI servers are the intermediate between the user interface and our model services, handling user requests, generating forecasts and providing the appropriate responses
it uses swagger UI that, upon deployment, generates documentation that can be foun in localhost with port 8888 [](http://enershare.epu.ntua.gr:8888/docs#/) 
It deploys two (2) endpoints, one for each service with the following openAPI descriptions
