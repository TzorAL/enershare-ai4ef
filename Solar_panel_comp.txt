Solar_panel_comp.csv
File Description: 
This file refers to private houses (one- and two-apartment houses) that have installed solar panels with public funding in Latvia. The second csv file is not related to this file - they are other private houses that have chosen to increase their energy efficiency with public funding.

High-Level Column Descriptions: 
Columns A-D: Basic information about the project.
Columns E-G: The initial situation in the house.
Columns H-L: The situation in the house after the installation of solar panels.
